# ImageScanningOCR
OCR Implementation through Javascript and Node.js codes

1- The file Index.HTML is the file you access to test out the code, it contains a choose file section where you select an image for it to scan, it uses the tesseract,js library as a source so that it can run the functions necessary to scan it.

2- The file test.js was an attempt at implementing it so that it would extract the text and output it into a pdf file but it failed.

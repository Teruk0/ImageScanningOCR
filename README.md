# ImageScanningOCR
OCR Implementation through Javascript and Node.js codes

1- The file Index.HTML is the file you access to test out the code, you double click on it to start the program, it contains a choose file section where you select an image for it to scan, it uses the tesseract,js library as a source so that it can run the functions necessary to scan it.

2- The file test.js was an attempt at implementing it so that it would extract the text and output it into a pdf file but it failed.

3- The image file that you select can be any from your computer though the result will vary depending on file type/quality/colors.

4- In order to make changes to the file just open the index.html file in an IDE OF YOUR CHOICE.

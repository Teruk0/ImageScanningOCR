# ImageScanningOCR
OCR Implementation through Javascript and Node.js codes

0- Install the Tesseract package following the information in this link:https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/

1- The file Index.HTML is the file you access to test out the code, you double click on it to start the program, it contains a choose file section where you select an image for it to scan, it uses the tesseract,js library as a source so that it can run the functions necessary to scan it.

2- The file test.js was an attempt at implementing it so that it would extract the text and output it into a pdf file but it failed.

3- The image file that you select can be any from your computer though the result will vary depending on file type/quality/colors.
(you have to reload the page every three images because it takes longer to do it).

4- In order to make changes to the file just open the index.html file in an IDE OF YOUR CHOICE.
